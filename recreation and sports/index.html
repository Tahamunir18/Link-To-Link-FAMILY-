    Recreation And Sports</h1>
  <p align="center" style="font-size:21px;"><b>Most sports played in Pakistan originated and were substantially
      developed by athletes and sports fans from the United Kingdom who introduced them during the British Raj. Field
      hockey is the national sport of Pakistan; it has won three gold medals in the Olympic Games held in 1960, 1968,
      and 1984. Pakistan has also won the Hockey World Cup a record four times, held in 1971, 1978, 1982, and
      1994.<br>
  however, is the most popular game across the country. The country has had an array of success in the sport over
  the years, and has the distinct achievement of having won each of the major ICC international cricket tournaments: ICC
  Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20, and ICC Champions Trophy; as well as the ICC Test Championship. The cricket
  team (known as Shaheen) won the Cricket World Cup held in 1992; it was runner-up once, in 1999. Pakistan was runner-up
  in the inaugural World Twenty20 (2007) in South Africa and won the World Twenty20 in England in 2009. In March 2009,
  militants attacked the touring Sri Lankan cricket team, after which no international cricket was played in
  Pakistan until May 2015, when the Zimbabwean team agreed to a tour. Pakistan also won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy by
  defeating arch-rivals India in the final.<br>

  Pakistan Super League is one of the largest cricket leagues of the world with a brand value of about Rs. 32.26 billion
  (US$140 million).<br>

  Association football is the second-most played sport in Pakistan and it is organised and regulated by the Pakistan
  Football Federation. Football in Pakistan is as old as the country itself. Shortly after the creation of Pakistan
  in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first
  Patron-in-Chief.[35] The highest football division in Pakistan is the Pakistan Premier League. Pakistan is known
  as one of the best manufacturers of the official FIFA World Cup ball. The best football players to play for
  Pakistan are Kaleemullah, Zesh Rehman, Muhammad Essa, Haroon Yousaf, and Muhammad Adil.<br>

  Pakistan has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events: the 1989 and 2004 South Asian Games; the 1984,
  1993, 1996 and 2003 World Squash Championships; the 1987 and 1996 Cricket World Cup; and the 1990 Hockey World Cup.
  Pakistan is set to host the 2024 South Asian Games.
  <b>There are also some traditional games of Pakistan, such as kabaddi, which are popular.</b></b></p>
