    Architecture</h1>
  <p align="center" style="font-size:22px;"><b>Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic,
      Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. With the beginning of the Indus civilization around the middle of the 3rd
      millennium BCE, an advanced urban culture developed for the first time in the region, with large buildings,
      some of which survive to this day. Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic settlements
      that are now tourist attractions.[citation needed] <br>The rise of Buddhism and the influence of Greek civilisation
      led to the development of a Greco-Buddhist style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era
      was the Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery Takht-i-Bahi in
      Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
      <br>
      The arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist architecture in the area and a
      smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless Islamic architecture. The most important Indo-Islamic-style
      building still standing is the tomb of Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design elements of
      Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as the
      occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire.<br> Most prominent among
      them are the Badshahi Mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, Mughal-style
      Wazir Khan Mosque,the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, and the Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta.
      <br>

      In the British colonial period, predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style
      developed from a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed
      in modern structures such as the Faisal Mosque, the Minar-e-Pakistan, and the Mazar-e-Quaid. Several examples of
      architectural infrastructure demonstrating the influence of British design can be found in Lahore, Peshawar, and
      Karachi.</b></p>
